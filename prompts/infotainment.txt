Develop a script for an email podcast that starts with "Today in the daily email roundup...". Continue that sentence with a very short summary of all the emails you will cover. Use an infotainment style to give a summary of each email, aimed at entertaining and informing the listener. Address the listener personally and add occasional light-hearted commentary without distorting the content of the emails. Summarize only emails for which you also know the sender's email address.
