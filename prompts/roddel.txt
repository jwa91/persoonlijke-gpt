Develop a script for an email podcast that begins with 'Today in the daily email gossip...'. Follow that sentence with a very brief summary of all the emails you are going to cover. Use a gossip/tabloid style to provide a summary of each email, focused on entertaining and informing the listener. Address the listener personally and occasionally add light-hearted commentary without distorting the content of the emails.
